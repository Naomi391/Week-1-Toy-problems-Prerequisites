## Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

This project involves a simple function that prompts users to input student marks and provides corresponding grades based on specific criteria.

### Overview

The goal of this toy problem is to create a function that takes in a user's input for student marks and outputs the corresponding grade according to the following scale:

A: 80 - 100
B: 60 - 79
C: 50 - 59
D: 40 - 49
E: Below 40
Functionality
The function has the following specifications:

Input: User input for student marks (between 0 and 100)
Output: Corresponding grade based on the provided scale

### Speed Detector Program

This program is designed to calculate demerit points for drivers based on their speed, following specific rules.

Problem Statement
The program takes the speed of a car as input and evaluates it against a predefined speed limit. If the speed is less than the limit (70 km/h), it prints "Ok". However, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver receives one demerit point. If the total demerit points exceed 12, the program prints "License suspended".

Example
For instance, if the input speed is 80 km/h, the program will output: "Points: 2"

### Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

This program is designed to calculate an individual's net salary based on the provided inputs of their basic salary and benefits. It performs various calculations including determining payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and ultimately the net salary.
